# raincheck

deployed application link http://127.0.0.1:5502/raincheck/raincheck/index.html

I created the API key named it and figured out how to use fetch to call the information on the weather 

styled the website so it shows the weather, search tab under it and the following search history regarding the weather, and the tempreture as well as expected weather 

I could not figure out how to ingratiate the wind speed and humidity levels
